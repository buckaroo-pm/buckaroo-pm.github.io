You can do anything you\nwant with them. You have no legal obligation\nto do anything else, although I appreciate attribution.\n\nThey are also licensed under the MIT open source license, if you have lawyers\nwho are unhappy with public domain. Every source file includes an explicit\ndual-license for you to choose from.\n\n#### <a name=\"other_libs\"></a> Are there other single-file public-domain/open source libraries with minimal dependencies out there?\n\n[Yes.](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs)\n\n#### If I wrap an stb library in a new library, does the new library have to be public domain/MIT?\n\nNo, because it's public domain you can freely relicense it to whatever license your new\nlibrary wants to be.\n\n#### What's the deal with SSE support in GCC-based compilers?\n\nstb_image will either use SSE2 (if you compile with -msse2) or\nwill not use any SIMD at all, rather than trying to detect the\nprocessor at runtime and handle it correctly. As I understand it,\nthe approved path in GCC for runtime-detection require\nyou to use multiple source files, one for each CPU configuration.\nBecause stb_image is a header-file library that compiles in only\none source file, there's no approved way to build both an\nSSE-enabled and a non-SSE-enabled variation.\n\nWhile we've tried to work around it, we've had multiple issues over\nthe years due to specific versions of gcc breaking what we're doing,\nso we've given up on it. See https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/280\nand https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/410 for examples.\n\n#### Some of these libraries seem redundant to existing open source libraries. Are they better somehow?\n\nGenerally they're only better in that they're easier to integrate,\neasier to use, and easier to release (single file; good API; no\nattribution requirement). They may be less featureful, slower,\nand/or use more memory. If you're already using an equivalent\nlibrary, there's probably no good reason to switch.\n\n#### Can I link directly to the table of stb libraries?\n\nYou can use [this URL](https://github.com/nothings/stb#stb_libs) to link directly to that list.\n\n#### Why do you list \"lines of code\"? It's a terrible metric.\n\nJust to give you some idea of the internal complexity of the library,\nto help you manage your expectations, or to let you know what you're\ngetting into. While not all the libraries are written in the same\nstyle, they're certainly similar styles, and so comparisons between\nthe libraries are probably still meaningful.\n\nNote though that the lines do include both the implementation, the\npart that corresponds to a header file, and the documentation.\n\n#### Why single-file headers?\n\nWindows doesn't have standard directories where libraries\nlive. That makes deploying libraries in Windows a lot more\npainful than open source developers on Unix-derivates generally\nrealize. (It also makes library dependencies a lot worse in Windows.)\n\nThere's also a common problem in Windows where a library was built\nagainst a different version of the runtime library, which causes\nlink conflicts and confusion. Shipping the libs as headers means\nyou normally just compile them straight into your project without\nmaking libraries, thus sidestepping that problem.\n\nMaking them a single file makes it very easy to just\ndrop them into a project that needs them. (Of course you can\nstill put them in a proper shared library tree if you want.)\n\nWhy not two files, one a header and one an implementation?\nThe difference between 10 files and 9 files is not a big deal,\nbut the difference between 2 files and 1 file is a big deal.\nYou don't need to zip or tar the files up, you don't have to\nremember to attach *two* files, etc.\n\n#### Why \"stb\"? Is this something to do with Set-Top Boxes?\n\nNo, they are just the initials for my name, Sean T. Barrett.\nThis was not chosen out of egomania, but as a moderately sane\nway of namespacing the filenames and source function names.\n\n#### Will you add more image types to stb_image.h?\n\nIf people submit them, I generally add them, but the goal of stb_image\nis less for applications like image viewer apps (which need to support\nevery type of image under the sun) and more for things like games which\ncan choose what images to use, so I may decline to add them if they're\ntoo rare or if the size of implementation vs. apparent benefit is too low.\n\n#### Do you have any advice on how to create my own single-file library?\n\nYes. https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt\n\n#### Why public domain?\n\nI prefer it over GPL, LGPL, BSD, zlib, etc. for many reasons.\nSome of them are listed here:\nhttps://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/why_public_domain.md\n\n#### Why C?\n\nPrimarily, because I use C, not C++. But it does also make it easier\nfor other people to use them from other languages.\n\n#### Why not C99? stdint.h, declare-anywhere, etc.\n\nI still use MSVC 6 (1998) as my IDE because it has better human factors\nfor me than later versions of MSVC.\n\n\n\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:stb\" ]\n","lockFile":"","buck":"prebuilt_cxx_library(\n  name = 'stb', \n  header_only = True, \n  header_namespace = '', \n  exported_headers = [\n    'stb.h', \n  ], \n  visibility = [\n    'PUBLIC', \n  ], \n)\n","bazel":"","deps":[],"lock":[]}],"updated":"2018-11-12T18:24:29Z","updatedUpstream":"2021-01-13T22:20:58Z","contributors":[{"login":"sgraham","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1822?u=4e60af1521c3dbd5b099cccccb1701aec76349cd&v=4"},{"login":"jorgenpt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21258?u=ed4c634e87dbf24ab7e3c4f84dbd14d37e28ff0b&v=4"},{"login":"cap","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22780?v=4"},{"login":"RobLoach","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25086?v=4"},{"login":"krig","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25527?u=b94d2d83155bce88742423ac31891f2f5ed07397&v=4"},{"login":"vincentisambart","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/34704?u=8f031be277fb554ba577fdc33fab0cd449c64430&v=4"},{"login":"akx","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/58669?u=a48a7439c9b7bcb7b3c82a05f76c2d9f6451baa3&v=4"},{"login":"kinetiknz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/67343?v=4"},{"login":"jlnr","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/70772?v=4"},{"login":"adurdin","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/81129?u=11777060882ab89cf429a896046b4d7e7cf7c06e&v=4"},{"login":"kritzikratzi","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/96657?v=4"},{"login":"friesencr","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105460?v=4"},{"login":"Try","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/122894?u=c31f94aac5809611fae93890ed8ca5ebe184c678&v=4"},{"login":"debiatan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/129583?v=4"},{"login":"enginmanap","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/237148?u=7a288db0b733165b8e0394b0682d916f202b0e2b&v=4"},{"login":"GrayHatter","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/243408?u=58e266eae8bc986a8a96a46f16d683a3bf44a504&v=4"},{"login":"serge-rgb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/282970?u=112fea845e83cd92c55e57196db3aad701a877a0&v=4"},{"login":"blackpawn","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/286270?v=4"},{"login":"1ace","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/297576?u=acb0d75d26c8764500a0ec6746b974ceeeb94efa&v=4"},{"login":"MarcoLizza","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/297849?u=fb1192626912cb17430c98a7947434051040564b&v=4"},{"login":"aras-p","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/348087?u=41311731f3f004fab8817c14c0440e09a29caa48&v=4"},{"login":"phprus","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/382460?v=4"},{"login":"zanshi","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/387671?v=4"},{"login":"zturtleman","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/405505?u=569955060ad5981e4e5e84275c2fa743037a31bd&v=4"},{"login":"mastensg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/431407?v=4"}],"fundingLinks":[],"contactLinks":[],"stars":14588,"forks":4977,"topics":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
