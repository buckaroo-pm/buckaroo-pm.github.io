And if that's not the case, open an issue!\n\n# Learning\n\nShould you wish to learn more, feel free to [watch our Meeting C++ 2015 lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8XSDhWx7hY)!\n\nWant more? Our [CppCon 2016 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky0JdPh_LgE) explains in details the library concepts and goes through two concrete usages.\n\nIf you are looking to learn the concepts of metaprogramming, [have a look at our free e-book](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/practical-c-plus-plus-metaprogramming.csp).\n\n# Tutorials\n\n *
