FLTK provides\n    modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D\n    graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation. It\n    was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is\n    currently maintained by a small group of developers across\n    the world with a central repository in the US.\n\n    For more information see file README.\n","versions":[],"updated":"2018-11-08T15:28:27Z","updatedUpstream":"2021-01-13T21:52:44Z","contributors":[{"login":"Taeril","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5956?v=4"},{"login":"airbrett","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/78085?v=4"},{"login":"michaelld","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/157892?v=4"},{"login":"michaelrsweet","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/488103?u=f6d4cdfdc64276140e51476ae3c6daf7f9f45275&v=4"},{"login":"ras0219","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/533828?v=4"},{"login":"MatthiasWM","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/653993?u=dbf0a4443afe7c62d85319753e60be910aaa75f2&v=4"},{"login":"clbr","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/790333?v=4"},{"login":"dejlek","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/851381?v=4"},{"login":"spitzak","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1229073?u=ad1123c581bc4b5d5f03afb71bd85c41d9921fca&v=4"},{"login":"informationsea","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1336578?v=4"},{"login":"newtonallen3","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2360361?u=a1667e3c3130b4d3aaf04382b5426307ef9a361a&v=4"},{"login":"Lasander","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2403878?v=4"},{"login":"ComputerNerd","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3759375?v=4"},{"login":"darealshinji","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5700937?u=4cc3193010cdebcd70469c9ede476374b3a1c316&v=4"},{"login":"fab672000","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6124901?u=0b3d3febeea745e12cfc38e10fb004be19f93771&v=4"},{"login":"erco77","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6484779?u=5e77bfc2a5a0e4ae05df620ed54e64e93ea51bae&v=4"},{"login":"CendioOssman","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6640916?u=d23e38c3c750e5ebe61e78170aa6d21cf453baad&v=4"},{"login":"engelsman","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8302798?v=4"},{"login":"fire-eggs","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9809727?u=90613d1ac1a226dd29b96d6d0cb7c8d847880122&v=4"},{"login":"Albrecht-S","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/26235500?u=5cb44d61eed32f1aef28c195269c1a65d959b28b&v=4"},{"login":"imaclmaca","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/26262392?v=4"},{"login":"MoAlyousef","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/37966791?u=10197b48ff764e4a2db111d28319bb63e98d4c0e&v=4"},{"login":"ManoloFLTK","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/41016272?v=4"}],"fundingLinks":[],"contactLinks":[],"stars":503,"forks":117,"topics":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
