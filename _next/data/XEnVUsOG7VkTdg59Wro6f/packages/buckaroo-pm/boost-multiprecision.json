The big number types in Multiprecision can be used with a wide selection of basic \n mathematical operations, elementary transcendental functions as well as the functions in Boost.Math. The Multiprecision types can \n also interoperate with the built-in types in C++ using clearly defined conversion rules. This allows Boost.Multiprecision to be \n used for all kinds of mathematical calculations involving integer, rational and floating-point types requiring extended range and precision.\n\nMultiprecision consists of a generic interface to the mathematics of large numbers as well as a selection of big number back ends, with \nsupport for integer, rational and floating-point types. Boost.Multiprecision provides a selection of back ends provided off-the-rack in \nincluding interfaces to GMP, MPFR, MPIR, TomMath as well as its own collection of Boost-licensed, header-only back ends for integers, \nrationals, floats and complex. In addition, user-defined back ends can be created and used with the interface of Multiprecision\n, provided the class implementation adheres to the necessary concepts.\n\nDepending upon the number type, precision may be arbitrarily large (limited only by available memory), fixed at compile time \n(for example 50 or 100 decimal digits), or a variable controlled at run-time by member functions. The types are expression-template-enabled \nfor better performance than naive user-defined types. \n\nThe full documentation is available on [boost.org](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multiprecision/index.html).\n\n## Support, bugs and feature requests ##\n\nBugs and feature requests can be reported through the [Gitub issue tracker](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues)\n(see [open issues](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues) and\n[closed issues](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)).\n\nYou can submit your changes through a [pull request](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/pulls).\n\nThere is no mailing-list specific to Boost Multiprecision, although you can use the general-purpose Boost [mailing-list](http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users) using the tag [multiprecision].\n\n\n## Development ##\n\nClone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost projects as submodules ([see boost+git doc](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started)): \n\n    git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost\n    cd boost\n    git submodule update --init\n\nThe Boost Multiprecision Library is located in `libs/multiprecision/`. \n\n### Running tests ###\nFirst, make sure you are in `libs/multiprecision/test`. \nYou can either run all the tests listed in `Jamfile.v2` or run a single test:\n\n    ../../../b2                        <- run all tests\n    ../../../b2 test_complex           <- single test\n\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:multiprecision\" ]\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/boost-config\"\nversion =
