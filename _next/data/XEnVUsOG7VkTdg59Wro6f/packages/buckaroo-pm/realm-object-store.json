{"pageProps":{"data":{"packageName":"buckaroo-pm/realm-object-store","name":"realm/realm-object-store","licence":"Apache-2.0","description":"Cross-platform abstractions used within Realm products","readme":"# Realm Object Store\n\nThe object store contains cross-platform abstractions used in Realm products. It is not intended to be used directly.\n\nThe object store consists of the following components:\n- `object_store`/`schema`/`object_schema`/`property` - contains the structures and logic used to setup and modify Realm files and their schema.\n- `shared_realm` - wraps the `object_store` APIs to provide transactions, notifications, Realm caching, migrations, and other higher level functionality.\n- `object_accessor`/`results`/`list` - accessor classes, object creation/update pipeline, and helpers for creating platform specific property getters and setters.\n\nEach Realm product may use only a subset of the provided components depending on its needs.\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nPlease report bugs against the Realm product that you're using:\n\n* [Realm Java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java)\n* [Realm Objective-C](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)\n* [Realm React Native](https://github.com/realm/realm-js)\n* [Realm Swift](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)\n* [Realm Xamarin](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet)\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThe object store's CMake build system currently only supports building for OS X, Linux, and Android.\n\nThe object store code supports being built for all Apple platforms, Linux and Android when used along with the relevant Realm product's build system.\n\n## Building\n\n1. Download dependencies:\n    ```\n    git submodule update --init\n    ```\n\n2. Install CMake. You can download an installer for OS X from the [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/), or install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):\n    ```\n    brew install cmake\n    ```\n\n3. Generate build files:\n\n    ```\n    cmake .\n    ```\n\n    If building for Android, the path for the Android NDK must be specified. For example, if it was installed with homebrew:\n\n    ```\n    cmake -DREALM_PLATFORM=Android -DANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/Cellar/android-ndk-r10e/r10e/ .\n    ```\n\n    If you want to use XCode as your editor, you can generate a XCode project with:\n    ```\n    cmake -G Xcode .\n    ```\n\n4. Build:\n\n    ```\n    make\n    ```\n\n## Building With Sync Support\n\nIf you wish to build with sync enabled, invoke `cmake` like so:\n\n```\ncmake -DREALM_ENABLE_SYNC=1\n```\n\n### Building Against a Local Version of Core\n\nIf you wish to build against a local version of core you can invoke `cmake` like so:\n\n```\ncmake -DREALM_CORE_PREFIX=/path/to/realm-core\n```\n\nThe given core tree will be built as part of the object store build.\n\n### Building Against a Local Version of Sync\n\nSpecify the path to realm-core and realm-sync when invoking `cmake`:\n\n```\ncmake -DREALM_ENABLE_SYNC=1 -DREALM_CORE_PREFIX=/path/to/realm-core -DREALM_SYNC_PREFIX=/path/to/realm-sync\n```\n\nPrebuilt sync binaries are currently not supported.\n\n### Building with Sanitizers\n\nThe object store can be built using ASan, TSan and/or UBSan by specifying `-DSANITIZE_ADDRESS=1`, `-DSANITIZE_THREAD=1`, or `-DSANITIZE_UNDEFINED=1` when invoking CMake.\nBuilding with ASan requires specifying a path to core with `-DREALM_CORE_PREFIX` as core needs to also be built with ASan enabled.\n\nOn OS X, the Xcode-provided copy of Clang only comes with ASan, and using TSan or UBSan requires a custom build of Clang.\nIf you have installed Clang as an external Xcode toolchain (using the `install-xcode-toolchain` when building LLVM), note that you'll have to specify `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++` when running `cmake` to stop cmake from being too clever.\n\n## Testing\n\n```\nmake run-tests\n```\n\n### Android\n\nIt requires a root device or an emulator:\n\n```\nmake\nadb push tests/tests /data/local/tmp\nadb shell /data/local/tmp/tests\n```\n\n## Using Docker\n\nThe `Dockerfile` included in this repo will provision a Docker image suitable\nfor building and running tests for both the Linux and Android platforms.\n\n```\n# Build Docker image from Dockerfile\ndocker build -t \"objectstore\" .\n# Run bash interactively from the built Docker image,\n# mounting the current directory\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp objectstore bash\n# Build the object store for Linux and run tests\n> cmake .\n> make\n> make run-tests\n```\n\nRefer to the rest of this document for instructions to build/test in other\nconfigurations.\n\n## License\n\nRealm Object Store is published under the Apache 2.0 license. The [underlying core](https://github.com/realm/realm-core) is also published under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\n**This product is not being made available to any person located in Cuba, Iran,\nNorth
