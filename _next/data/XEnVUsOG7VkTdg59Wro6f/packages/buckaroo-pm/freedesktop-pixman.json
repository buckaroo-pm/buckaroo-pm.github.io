{"pageProps":{"data":{"packageName":"buckaroo-pm/freedesktop-pixman","name":"aseprite/pixman","licence":"NOASSERTION","description":"Pixman mirror","readme":"Pixman is a library that provides low-level pixel manipulation\nfeatures such as image compositing and trapezoid rasterization.\n\nQuestions, bug reports and patches should be directed to the pixman\nmailing list:\n\n        http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/pixman\n\nYou can also file bugs at\n\n        https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=pixman\n\nFor real time discussions about pixman, feel free to join the IRC\nchannels #cairo and #xorg-devel on the FreeNode IRC network.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIn order to contribute to pixman, you will need a working knowledge of\nthe git version control system. For a quick getting started guide,\nthere is the \"Everyday Git With 20 Commands Or So guide\"\n\n        http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html\n\nfrom the Git homepage. For more in depth git documentation, see the\nresources on the Git community documentation page:\n\n        http://git-scm.com/documentation\n\nPixman uses the infrastructure from the freedesktop.org umbrella\nproject. For instructions about how to use the git service on\nfreedesktop.org, see:\n\n        http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/Developers\n\nThe Pixman master repository can be found at:\n\n\tgit://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/pixman\n\nand browsed on the web here:\n\n\thttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/\n\n\nSending patches\n---------------\n\nThe general workflow for sending patches is to first make sure that\ngit can send mail on your system. Then, \n\n - create a branch off of master in your local git repository\n\n - make your changes as one or more commits\n\n - use the \n\n        git send-email\n\n   command to send the patch series to pixman@lists.freedesktop.org.\n\nIn order for your patches to be accepted, please consider the\nfollowing guidelines:\n\n - This link:\n\n        http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#patch-series\n\n   describes how what a good patch series is, and to create one with\n   git.\n\n - At each point in the series, pixman should compile and the test\n   suite should pass.\n\n   The exception here is if you are changing the test suite to\n   demonstrate a bug. In this case, make one commit that makes the\n   test suite fail due to the bug, and then another commit that fixes\n   the bug.\n\n   You can run the test suite with \n\n        make check\n\n   It will take around two minutes to run on a modern PC.\n\n - Follow the coding style described in the CODING_STYLE file\n\n - For bug fixes, include an update to the test suite to make sure\n   the bug doesn't reappear.\n\n - For new features, add tests of the feature to the test\n   suite. Also, add a program demonstrating the new feature to the\n   demos/ directory.\n\n - Write descriptive commit messages. Useful information to include:\n        - Benchmark results, before and after\n\t- Description of the bug that was fixed\n\t- Detailed rationale for any new API\n\t- Alternative approaches that were rejected (and why they\n          don't work)\n\t- If review comments were incorporated, a brief version\n          history describing what those changes were.\n\n - For big patch series, send an introductory email with an overall\n   description of the patch series, including benchmarks and\n   motivation. Each commit message should still be descriptive and\n   include enough information to understand why this particular commit\n   was necessary.\n\nPixman has high standards for code quality and so almost everybody\nshould expect to have the first versions of their patches rejected.\n\nIf you think that the reviewers are wrong about something, or that the\nguidelines above are wrong, feel free to discuss the issue on the\nlist. The purpose of the guidelines and code review is to ensure high\ncode quality; it is not an exercise in compliance.\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:pixman-1\"
