Your distributions bug reporter. If you are using a distribution your first\nport of call is their bug tracker. This is because each distribution has their\nown patches and way of dealing with bugs. Also bug reporting often does not need\nany subscription to websites.\n2. GitLab Issues - To the left of this page is the issue tracker. You can report\nbugs here.\n3. Email list - We have an email list (see below) where you can report bugs.\nThe problem with this method is bug reports often get lost and cannot be\ntracked. This is especially a big problem when its something that will take\ntime to resolve.\n\nIf you need to report bugs, there is more details on the\n[Bug Reporting](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/blob/master/Documentation/bugs.md)\npage.\n\n## Email List\nThe email list for the developers and users of procps is found at\nhttp://www.freelists.org/archive/procps/\nThis email list discusses the development of procps and is used by distributions\nto also forward or discuss bugs.\n","versions":[],"updated":"2019-02-21T14:56:34Z","updatedUpstream":"2019-02-21T14:56:34Z","contributors":[],"fundingLinks":[],"contactLinks":[],"stars":0,"forks":1,"topics":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
