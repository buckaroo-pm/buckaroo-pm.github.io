This repository is a subtree split from the [github mirror of ROOT](https://github.com/root-mirror/root). Commits are not squashed to\nretain info on history. The master branch is for local development, the\nupstream branch will retain the pristine sources from the mirror, to\nbe updated on a semi regular basis!\n\nPurpose\n=======\n\nRead and edit text lines, and write what was read.\n\nThis library is a simplistic alternative to readline / editline. It offers\nless functionality but it has a more liberal license (see [LICENSE.TXT](LICENSE.TXT) in\nthe topmost) directory, it has no external dependencies, and it works on\nall platforms that I tested:\n\n- Linux\n- Windows (probably >= 2000)\n- MacOS\n- Solaris\n\nAdding other platforms is trivial.\n\nInternal Design\n===============\n\n[TextInput.h](textinput/TextInput.h) contains the main interface.\nThe reading can be extended by adding classes that derive\nfrom [`textinput::Reader`](textinput/Reader.h); the displaying can\nbe extended by deriving from [`textinput::Display`](textinput/Display.h).\n\nThere can be multiple readers and multiple displays. All displays are\nequal, all readers are equal. All displays show the input of all\nreaders. The terminal / console implementations for readers and\ndisplays are provided. Both readers and displays only attach while\ntextinput is acively reading input. As soon as the input is done (enter\nwas pressed), they detach from the terminal, allowing the application\nto take control of the terminal, and even to crash without leaving the\nterminal in a non-default state.\n\nThe editor provides basic emacs-like keybinding, as known from e.g.\nbash. It supports ^O, ^R (for now without regex), and most word-centric\nediting commands. See [`textinput::KeyBinding`](textinput/KeyBinding.h)\nfor details.\n\nKeyBinding maps the InputData read from the Reader to `Editor::Commands`.\nThe Editor performs the requested editing actions, and the Displays\nare informed about the changes. TextInput gives access to the read\nstate (\"are we done?\") and the input.\n\nWhy no [N]Curses?\n-----------------\n\nBecause of platform independence (well, one could still have a\nTerminalDisplayCurses) and because nowadays this is actually rarely\nneeded. Sure, it's the \"right\" way of interfacing terminals. But the\nnumber of terminal types in the wild has siginifantly decreased, so\njust hard-coding escape sequences became a viable alternative.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nThese pages helped when writing libtextinput:\n\n- http://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node129.html\n- http://rtfm.etla.org/xterm/ctlseq.html\n- http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes\n\nThanks a lot to the authors for creating these useful pages!\n\nAxel Naumann <axel@cern.ch>, May 2011\n\n\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:textinput\" ]","lockFile":"manifest = \"16ac5a9e281e5844038bb11b3e44d96e289909d9bbff783420b81de8ea70818e\"\n\n","buck":"load('//:subdir_glob.bzl', 'subdir_glob')\n\ncxx_library(\n  name = 'textinput',\n  header_namespace = '',\n  exported_headers = subdir_glob([\n    ('', 'textinput/**/*.h'),\n  ]),\n  srcs = glob([\n    'textinput/**/*.cpp',\n  ]),\n  visibility = [\n    'PUBLIC',\n  ],\n)\n","bazel":"","deps":[],"lock":[]}],"updated":"2019-02-03T17:44:35Z","updatedUpstream":"2014-04-11T14:52:03Z","contributors":[{"login":"Axel-Naumann","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/144675?v=4"},{"login":"drbenmorgan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1102642?u=4cd2da7500fc6bd4a9aaa0acdda2f25459f74d88&v=4"},{"login":"FonsRademakers","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2265419?v=4"},{"login":"bellenot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5236506?u=89180619b317eca088d379b6c0e3f50f48a9a1b3&v=4"}],"fundingLinks":[],"contactLinks":[],"stars":0,"forks":2,"topics":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
