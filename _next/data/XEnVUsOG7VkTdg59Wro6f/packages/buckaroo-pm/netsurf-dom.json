However, the code is well commented and the\npublic API may be found in the \"include\" directory. The testcase\nsources may also be of use in working out how to use it.\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:dom\" ]\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub\"\nversion = \"branch=master\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils\"\nversion = \"branch=master\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet\"\nversion = \"branch=master\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xml2\"\nversion = \"branch=master\"\n","lockFile":"manifest = \"960967b57e9242de3ca3227768de3c78b3747d2005536bd56b9081e40da20bb1\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub\"\ntarget = \"//:hubbub\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils\"\ntarget = \"//:parserutils\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet\"\ntarget = \"//:wapcaplet\"\n\n[[dependency]]\npackage = \"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xml2\"\ntarget = \"//:xml2\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/madler-zlib\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"906f727175ca6a7f8943e375467d6e461a55b68d\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"a927156c467f628d541a7692e431a70b55a24cde\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"bdee37e518fa178e8eaaa80fc6a8ac2eeb23f0be\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"6312c7378ab40e37594b04fcce7f8753998e737e\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet\".lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/check\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"53e84bd2ed5d98cf98cb91e781a2983d7d01425d\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xml2\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"d50aefc251efb38ed3c7ed5e7ee643583e0d4b9e\"\n\n[lock.\"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xz\"]\nversions = [ \"branch=master\" ]\nrevision = \"593cc1510a5b0f62d0d2167bdd57d36182a0cf35\"\n","buck":"load('//:buckaroo_macros.bzl', 'buckaroo_deps_from_package')\nload('//:subdir_glob.bzl', 'subdir_glob')\n\nparserutils = \\\n  buckaroo_deps_from_package('github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils')\n\nwapcaplet = \\\n  buckaroo_deps_from_package('github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet')\n\nprebuilt_cxx_library(\n  name = 'internal-headers',\n  header_namespace = '',\n  header_only = True,\n  exported_headers = subdir_glob([\n    ('src', '**/*.h'),\n  ]),\n  visibility = [\n    'PUBLIC',\n  ],\n)\n\ncxx_library(\n  name = 'dom',\n  header_namespace = '',\n  exported_headers = subdir_glob([\n    ('include', '**/*.h'),\n  ]),\n  headers = subdir_glob([\n    ('src', '**/*.h'),\n  ]),\n  srcs = glob([\n    'src/**/*.c',\n  ]),\n  deps = parserutils + wapcaplet,\n  visibility = [\n    'PUBLIC',\n  ],\n)\n","bazel":"","deps":[{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub","version":"branch=master"},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils","version":"branch=master"},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet","version":"branch=master"},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xml2","name":"buckaroo-pm/xml2","version":"branch=master"}],"lock":[{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/madler-zlib","name":"buckaroo-pm/madler-zlib","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"906f727175ca6a7f8943e375467d6e461a55b68d"}},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-hubbub","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"a927156c467f628d541a7692e431a70b55a24cde"}},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-parserutils","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"bdee37e518fa178e8eaaa80fc6a8ac2eeb23f0be"}},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet","name":"buckaroo-pm/netsurf-wapcaplet","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"6312c7378ab40e37594b04fcce7f8753998e737e","lock":{"github.com/buckaroo-pm/check":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"53e84bd2ed5d98cf98cb91e781a2983d7d01425d"}}}},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xml2","name":"buckaroo-pm/xml2","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"d50aefc251efb38ed3c7ed5e7ee643583e0d4b9e"}},{"uri":"github.com/buckaroo-pm/xz","name":"buckaroo-pm/xz","spec":{"versions":["branch=master"],"revision":"593cc1510a5b0f62d0d2167bdd57d36182a0cf35"}}]}],"updated":"2019-01-25T16:28:41Z","updatedUpstream":"2019-01-25T16:28:41Z","contributors":[],"fundingLinks":[],"contactLinks":[],"stars":0,"forks":1,"topics":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
