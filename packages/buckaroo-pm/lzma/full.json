  "readme": "\nLZMA Utils - legacy branch\n--------------------------\n\nIntroduction\n\n    LZMA Utils is an attempt to provide LZMA compression to POSIX-like\n    systems. The idea is to have a gzip-like command line tool and\n    a zlib-like library, which would make it easy to adapt the new\n    compression technology to existing applications.\n\nThis release\n\n    This is a stable release from the legacy branch of LZMA Utils. This\n    contains a limited gzip-like command line tool, decoding-only library\n    with zlib-like API, and some helper scripts for grepping and diffing.\n    \n    The legacy branch gets only bug fixes. It is maintained until the new\n    code base becomes stable.\n\nFuture\n\n    The current LZMA_Alone file format will be replaced with a new .lzma\n    format. The new format fixes various problems the LZMA_Alone format\n    such as lack of magic bytes and integrity check. The new tools will\n    transparently support the files in the old format, but the old tools\n    will never support the new format files.\n\n    lzmainfo will be gone. \"lzma -l\" i.e. \"lzma --list\" will replace it.\n    It's like \"gzip -l\" but for .lzma files. The output format will be\n    different from gzip and lzmainfo.\n\n    liblzmadec will be gone. It will be replaced with liblzma, which\n    supports also compression and many other things.\n\n    lzmadec will use liblzma instead of liblzmadec. lzmadec will support\n    giving the filenames to decode on the command line, and support\n    memory usage limitting.\n\nContact\n\n    The preferred way to contact is joining #tukaani on the Freenode\n    IRC network, and talk to Larhzu. Alternatively, you can email to\n    <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>.\n\n",
