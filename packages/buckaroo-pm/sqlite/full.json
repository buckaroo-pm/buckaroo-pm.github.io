  "readme": "<h1 align=\"center\">SQLite Source Repository</h1>\n\nThis repository contains the complete source code for the \n[SQLite database engine](https://sqlite.org/).  Some test scripts \nare also included.  However, many other test scripts\nand most of the documentation are managed separately.\n\nSQLite [does not use Git](https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html).\nIf you are reading this on GitHub, then you are looking at an\nunofficial mirror. See <https://sqlite.org/src> for the official\nrepository.\n\n## Obtaining The Code\n\nSQLite sources are managed using the\n[Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/), a distributed version control system\nthat was specifically designed to support SQLite development.\nIf you do not want to use Fossil, you can download tarballs or ZIP\narchives or [SQLite archives](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#sqlar) as follows:\n\n  *  Lastest trunk check-in as\n     [Tarball](https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz),\n     [ZIP-archive](https://www.sqlite.org/src/zip/sqlite.zip), or\n     [SQLite-archive](https://www.sqlite.org/src/sqlar/sqlite.sqlar).\n\n  *  Latest release as\n     [Tarball](https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz?r=release),\n     [ZIP-archive](https://www.sqlite.org/src/zip/sqlite.zip?r=release), or\n     [SQLite-archive](https://www.sqlite.org/src/sqlar/sqlite.sqlar?r=release).\n\n  *  For other check-ins, substitute an appropriate branch name or\n     tag or hash prefix for \"release\" in the URLs of the previous\n     bullet.  Or browse the [timeline](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline)\n     to locate the check-in desired, click on its information page link,\n     then click on the \"Tarball\" or \"ZIP Archive\" links on the information\n     page.\n\nIf you do want to use Fossil to check out the source tree, \nfirst install Fossil version 2.0 or later.\n(Source tarballs and precompiled binaries available\n[here](https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html).  Fossil is\na stand-alone program.  To install, simply download or build the single \nexecutable file and put that file someplace on your $PATH.)\nThen run commands like this:\n\n        mkdir ~/sqlite\n        cd ~/sqlite\n        fossil clone https://www.sqlite.org/src sqlite.fossil\n        fossil open sqlite.fossil\n    \nAfter setting up a repository using the steps above, you can always\nupdate to the lastest version using:\n\n        fossil update trunk   ;# latest trunk check-in\n        fossil update release ;# latest official release\n\nOr type \"fossil ui\" to get a web-based user interface.\n\n## Compiling\n\nFirst create a directory in which to place\nthe build products.  It is recommended, but not required, that the\nbuild directory be separate from the source directory.  Cd into the\nbuild directory and then from the build directory run the configure\nscript found at the root of the source tree.  Then run \"make\".\n\nFor example:\n\n        tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz    ;#  Unpack the source tree into \"sqlite\"\n        mkdir bld                ;#  Build will occur in a sibling directory\n        cd bld                   ;#  Change to the build directory\n        ../sqlite/configure      ;#  Run the configure script\n        make                     ;#  Run the makefile.\n        make sqlite3.c           ;#  Build the \"amalgamation\" source file\n        make test                ;#  Run some tests (requires Tcl)\n\nSee the makefile for additional targets.\n\nThe configure script uses autoconf 2.61 and libtool.  If the configure\nscript does not work out for you, there is a generic makefile named\n\"Makefile.linux-gcc\" in the top directory of the source tree that you\ncan copy and edit to suit your needs.  Comments on the generic makefile\nshow what changes are needed.\n\n## Using MSVC\n\nOn Windows, all applicable build products can be compiled with MSVC.\nFirst open the command prompt window associated with the desired compiler\nversion (e.g. \"Developer Command Prompt for VS2013\").  Next, use NMAKE\nwith the provided \"Makefile.msc\" to build one of the supported targets.\n\nFor example:\n\n        mkdir bld\n        cd bld\n        nmake /f Makefile.msc TOP=..\\sqlite\n        nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.c TOP=..\\sqlite\n        nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.dll TOP=..\\sqlite\n        nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.exe TOP=..\\sqlite\n        nmake /f Makefile.msc test TOP=..\\sqlite\n\nThere are several build options that can be set via the NMAKE command\nline.  For example, to build for WinRT, simply add \"FOR_WINRT=1\" argument\nto the \"sqlite3.dll\" command line above.  When debugging into the SQLite\ncode, adding the \"DEBUG=1\" argument to one of the above command lines is\nrecommended.\n\nSQLite does not require [Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/) to run, but a Tcl installation\nis required by the makefiles (including those for MSVC).  SQLite contains\na lot of generated code and Tcl is used to do much of that code generation.\n\n## Source Code Tour\n\nMost of the core source files are in the **src/** subdirectory.  The\n**src/** folder also contains files used to build the \"testfixture\" test\nharness. The names of the source files used by \"testfixture\" all begin\nwith \"test\".\nThe **src/** also contains the \"shell.c\" file\nwhich is the main program for the \"sqlite3.exe\"\n[command-line shell](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) and\nthe \"tclsqlite.c\" file which implements the\n[Tcl bindings](https://sqlite.org/tclsqlite.html) for SQLite.\n(Historical note:  SQLite began as a Tcl\nextension and only later escaped to the wild as an independent library.)\n\nTest scripts and programs are found in the **test/** subdirectory.\nAddtional test code is found in other source repositories.\nSee [How SQLite Is Tested](http://www.sqlite.org/testing.html) for\nadditional information.\n\nThe **ext/** subdirectory contains code for extensions.  The\nFull-text search engine is in **ext/fts3**.  The R-Tree engine is in\n**ext/rtree**.  The **ext/misc** subdirectory contains a number of\nsmaller, single-file extensions, such as a REGEXP operator.\n\nThe **tool/** subdirectory contains various scripts and programs used\nfor building generated source code files or for testing or for generating\naccessory programs such as \"sqlite3_analyzer(.exe)\".\n\n### Generated Source Code Files\n\nSeveral of the C-language source files used by SQLite are generated from\nother sources rather than being typed in manually by a programmer.  This\nsection will summarize those automatically-generated files.  To create all\nof the automatically-generated files, simply run \"make target&#95;source\".\nThe \"target&#95;source\" make target will create a subdirectory \"tsrc/\" and\nfill it with all the source files needed to build SQLite, both\nmanually-edited files and automatically-generated files.\n\nThe SQLite interface is defined by the **sqlite3.h** header file, which is\ngenerated from src/sqlite.h.in, ./manifest.uuid, and ./VERSION.  The\n[Tcl script](http://www.tcl.tk) at tool/mksqlite3h.tcl does the conversion.\nThe manifest.uuid file contains the SHA3 hash of the particular check-in\nand is used to generate the SQLITE\\_SOURCE\\_ID macro.  The VERSION file\ncontains the current SQLite version number.  The sqlite3.h header is really\njust a copy of src/sqlite.h.in with the source-id and version number inserted\nat just the right spots. Note that comment text in the sqlite3.h file is\nused to generate much of the SQLite API documentation.  The Tcl scripts\nused to generate that documentation are in a separate source repository.\n\nThe SQL language parser is **parse.c** which is generate from a grammar in\nthe src/parse.y file.  The conversion of \"parse.y\" into \"parse.c\" is done\nby the [lemon](./doc/lemon.html) LALR(1) parser generator.  The source code\nfor lemon is at tool/lemon.c.  Lemon uses the tool/lempar.c file as a\ntemplate for generating its parser.\n\nLemon also generates the **parse.h** header file, at the same time it\ngenerates parse.c. But the parse.h header file is\nmodified further (to add additional symbols) using the ./addopcodes.tcl\nTcl script.\n\nThe **opcodes.h** header file contains macros that define the numbers\ncorresponding to opcodes in the \"VDBE\" virtual machine.  The opcodes.h\nfile is generated by the scanning the src/vdbe.c source file.  The\nTcl script at ./mkopcodeh.tcl does this scan and generates opcodes.h.\nA second Tcl script, ./mkopcodec.tcl, then scans opcodes.h to generate\nthe **opcodes.c** source file, which contains a reverse mapping from\nopcode-number to opcode-name that is used for EXPLAIN output.\n\nThe **keywordhash.h** header file contains the definition of a hash table\nthat maps SQL language keywords (ex: \"CREATE\", \"SELECT\", \"INDEX\", etc.) into\nthe numeric codes used by the parse.c parser.  The keywordhash.h file is\ngenerated by a C-language program at tool mkkeywordhash.c.\n\nThe **pragma.h** header file contains various definitions used to parse\nand implement the PRAGMA statements.  The header is generated by a\nscript **tool/mkpragmatab.tcl**. If you want to add a new PRAGMA, edit\nthe **tool/mkpragmatab.tcl** file to insert the information needed by the\nparser for your new PRAGMA, then run the script to regenerate the\n**pragma.h** header file.\n\n### The Amalgamation\n\nAll of the individual C source code and header files (both manually-edited\nand automatically-generated) can be combined into a single big source file\n**sqlite3.c** called \"the amalgamation\".  The amalgamation is the recommended\nway of using SQLite in a larger application.  Combining all individual\nsource code files into a single big source code file allows the C compiler\nto perform more cross-procedure analysis and generate better code.  SQLite\nruns about 5% faster when compiled from the amalgamation versus when compiled\nfrom individual source files.\n\nThe amalgamation is generated from the tool/mksqlite3c.tcl Tcl script.\nFirst, all of the individual source files must be gathered into the tsrc/\nsubdirectory (using the equivalent of \"make target_source\") then the\ntool/mksqlite3c.tcl script is run to copy them all together in just the\nright order while resolving internal \"#include\" references.\n\nThe amalgamation source file is more than 200K lines long.  Some symbolic\ndebuggers (most notably MSVC) are unable to deal with files longer than 64K\nlines.  To work around this, a separate Tcl script, tool/split-sqlite3c.tcl,\ncan be run on the amalgamation to break it up into a single small C file\ncalled **sqlite3-all.c** that does #include on about seven other files\nnamed **sqlite3-1.c**, **sqlite3-2.c**, ..., **sqlite3-7.c**.  In this way,\nall of the source code is contained within a single translation unit so\nthat the compiler can do extra cross-procedure optimization, but no\nindividual source file exceeds 32K lines in length.\n\n## How It All Fits Together\n\nSQLite is modular in design.\nSee the [architectural description](http://www.sqlite.org/arch.html)\nfor details. Other documents that are useful in\n(helping to understand how SQLite works include the\n[file format](http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html) description,\nthe [virtual machine](http://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html) that runs\nprepared statements, the description of\n[how transactions work](http://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html), and\nthe [overview of the query planner](http://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html).\n\nYears of effort have gone into optimizating SQLite, both\nfor small size and high performance.  And optimizations tend to result in\ncomplex code.  So there is a lot of complexity in the current SQLite\nimplementation.  It will not be the easiest library in the world to hack.\n\nKey files:\n\n  *  **sqlite.h.in** - This file defines the public interface to the SQLite\n     library.  Readers will need to be familiar with this interface before\n     trying to understand how the library works internally.\n\n  *  **sqliteInt.h** - this header file defines many of the data objects\n     used internally by SQLite.  In addition to \"sqliteInt.h\", some\n     subsystems have their own header files.\n\n  *  **parse.y** - This file describes the LALR(1) grammar that SQLite uses\n     to parse SQL statements, and the actions that are taken at each step\n     in the parsing process.\n\n  *  **vdbe.c** - This file implements the virtual machine that runs\n     prepared statements.  There are various helper files whose names\n     begin with \"vdbe\".  The VDBE has access to the vdbeInt.h header file\n     which defines internal data objects.  The rest of SQLite interacts\n     with the VDBE through an interface defined by vdbe.h.\n\n  *  **where.c** - This file (together with its helper files named\n     by \"where*.c\") analyzes the WHERE clause and generates\n     virtual machine code to run queries efficiently.  This file is\n     sometimes called the \"query optimizer\".  It has its own private\n     header file, whereInt.h, that defines data objects used internally.\n\n  *  **btree.c** - This file contains the implementation of the B-Tree\n     storage engine used by SQLite.  The interface to the rest of the system\n     is defined by \"btree.h\".  The \"btreeInt.h\" header defines objects\n     used internally by btree.c and not published to the rest of the system.\n\n  *  **pager.c** - This file contains the \"pager\" implementation, the\n     module that implements transactions.  The \"pager.h\" header file\n     defines the interface between pager.c and the rest of the system.\n\n  *  **os_unix.c** and **os_win.c** - These two files implement the interface\n     between SQLite and the underlying operating system using the run-time\n     pluggable VFS interface.\n\n  *  **shell.c.in** - This file is not part of the core SQLite library.  This\n     is the file that, when linked against sqlite3.a, generates the\n     \"sqlite3.exe\" command-line shell.  The \"shell.c.in\" file is transformed\n     into \"shell.c\" as part of the build process.\n\n  *  **tclsqlite.c** - This file implements the Tcl bindings for SQLite.  It\n     is not part of the core SQLite library.  But as most of the tests in this\n     repository are written in Tcl, the Tcl language bindings are important.\n\n  *  **test*.c** - Files in the src/ folder that begin with \"test\" go into\n     building the \"testfixture.exe\" program.  The testfixture.exe program is\n     an enhanced Tcl shell.  The testfixture.exe program runs scripts in the\n     test/ folder to validate the core SQLite code.  The testfixture program\n     (and some other test programs too) is build and run when you type\n     \"make test\".\n\n  *  **ext/misc/json1.c** - This file implements the various JSON functions\n     that are build into SQLite.\n\nThere are many other source files.  Each has a succinct header comment that\ndescribes its purpose and role within the larger system.\n\n\n## Contacts\n\nThe main SQLite webpage is [http://www.sqlite.org/](http://www.sqlite.org/)\nwith geographically distributed backups at\n[http://www2.sqlite.org/](http://www2.sqlite.org) and\n[http://www3.sqlite.org/](http://www3.sqlite.org).\n",
