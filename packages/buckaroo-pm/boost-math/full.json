  "readme": "Boost Math Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math)\n==================\n\nThis library is divided into several interconnected parts:\n\n### Floating Point Utilities\n\nUtility functions for dealing with floating point arithmetic, includes functions for floating point classification (fpclassify, isnan, isinf etc), sign manipulation, rounding, comparison, and computing the distance between floating point numbers.\n\n### Specific Width Floating Point Types\n\nA set of typedefs similar to those provided by <cstdint> but for floating point types.\n\n### Mathematical Constants\n\nA wide range of constants ranging from various multiples of Ï€, fractions, Euler's constant, etc.\n\nThese are of course usable from template code, or as non-templates with a simplified interface if that is more appropriate.\n\n### Statistical Distributions\n\nProvides a reasonably comprehensive set of statistical distributions, upon which higher level statistical tests can be built.\n\nThe initial focus is on the central univariate distributions. Both continuous (like normal & Fisher) and discrete (like binomial & Poisson) distributions are provided.\n\nA comprehensive tutorial is provided, along with a series of worked examples illustrating how the library is used to conduct statistical tests.\n\n### Special Functions\n\nProvides a small number of high quality special functions; initially these were concentrated on functions used in statistical applications along with those in the Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions.\n\nThe function families currently implemented are the gamma, beta & error functions along with the incomplete gamma and beta functions (four variants of each) and all the possible inverses of these, plus the digamma, various factorial functions, Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, sinus cardinals (along with their hyperbolic variants), inverse hyperbolic functions, Legrendre/Laguerre/Hermite/Chebyshev polynomials and various special power and logarithmic functions.\n\nAll the implementations are fully generic and support the use of arbitrary \"real-number\" types, including Boost.Multiprecision, although they are optimised for use with types with known significand (or mantissa) sizes: typically float, double or long double.\n\nThese functions also provide the basis of support for the TR1 special functions.\n\n### Root Finding and Function Minimisation\n\nA comprehensive set of root-finding algorithms over the real line, both with derivatives and derivative free.\n\nAlso function minimisation via Brent's Method.\n\n### Polynomials and Rational Functions\n\nTools for manipulating polynomials and for efficient evaluation of rationals or polynomials.\n\n### Interpolation\n\nFunction interpolation via barycentric rational interpolation, compactly supported cubic B-splines, and the Chebyshev transform.\n\n### Numerical Integration and Differentiation\n\nA reasonably comprehensive set of routines for integration (trapezoidal, Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Kronrod, Gauss-Chebyshev, double-exponential, and Monte-Carlo) and differentiation (Chebyshev transform, finite difference, and the complex step derivative).\n\nThe integration routines are usable for functions returning complex results - and hence can be used for computation of  contour integrals.\n\n### Quaternions and Octonions\n\nQuaternion and Octonians as class templates similar to std::complex.\n\nThe full documentation is available on [boost.org](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/math).\n\n|                  |  Master  |   Develop   |\n|------------------|----------|-------------|\n| Travis           | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math)  |  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/math) |\n| Appveyor         | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cnugjx9dt7cou7nj/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jzmaddock/math/branch/master) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cnugjx9dt7cou7nj/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jzmaddock/math/branch/develop)  |\n\n\n\n## Support, bugs and feature requests ##\n\nBugs and feature requests can be reported through the [Gitub issue tracker](https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues)\n(see [open issues](https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues) and\n[closed issues](https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)).\n\nYou can submit your changes through a [pull request](https://github.com/boostorg/math/pulls).\n\nThere is no mailing-list specific to Boost Math, although you can use the general-purpose Boost [mailing-list](http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users) using the tag [math].\n\n\n## Development ##\n\nClone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost projects as submodules ([see boost+git doc](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started)):\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost\n    $ cd boost\n    $ git submodule update --init\n\nThe Boost Math Library is located in `libs/math/`.\n\n### Running tests ###\nFirst, make sure you are in `libs/math/test`.\nYou can either run all the tests listed in `Jamfile.v2` or run a single test:\n\n    test$ ../../../b2                        <- run all tests\n    test$ ../../../b2 static_assert_test     <- single test\n    test$ # A more advanced syntax, demoing various options for building the tests:\n    test$ ../../../b2 -a -j2 -q --reconfigure toolset=clang cxxflags=\"--std=c++14 -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined\" linkflags=\"-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address\"\n    \n### Building documentation ###\n\nFull instructions can be found [here](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/wiki/BoostDocs/GettingStarted), but to reiterate slightly:\n\n```bash\nlibs/math/doc$ brew install docbook-xsl # on mac\nlibs/math/doc$ touch ~/user-config.jam\nlibs/math/doc$ # now edit so that:\nlibs/math/doc$ cat ~/user-config.jam\nusing darwin ;\n\nusing xsltproc ;\n\nusing boostbook\n    : /usr/local/opt/docbook-xsl/docbook-xsl\n    ;\n\nusing doxygen ;\nusing quickbook ;\nlibs/math/doc$ ../../../b2\n```\n",
