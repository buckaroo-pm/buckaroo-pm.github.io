  "readme": "Spirit\n======\n\nSpirit is a set of C++ libraries for parsing and output generation implemented as \nDomain Specific Embedded Languages (DSEL) using Expression templates and Template \nMeta-Programming. The Spirit libraries enable a target grammar to be written \nexclusively in C++. Inline grammar specifications can mix freely with other \nC++ code and, thanks to the generative power of C++ templates, are immediately \nexecutable.\n\n### Spirit.X3 (3rd generation)\n\n[Documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/x3/html/index.html)\n\nThe newest Spirit shines faster compile times. Currently only a parser framework.\n\nRequires C++14 compiler (GCC 5, Clang 3.5, VS 2015 Update 3).\n\n### Spirit V2 (2nd generation)\n\n[Documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/index.html)\n\nThe latest Long Term Support version of Spirit. A Swiss Army knife for data\nmanipulation on any kind of input.\n\nConsists of:\n  - [Qi]: Parser framework.\n  - [Karma]: Generator framework.\n  - [Lex]: Lexical analyzer framework.\n  \nRuns on most C++03 compilers (GCC 4.1, Clang 3.0, VS 2005).\n\n[Spirit V2]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/index.html\n[Qi]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi.html\n[Karma]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/karma.html\n[Lex]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/lex.html\n\n### Spirit.Classic (1st generation)\n\n[Documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/classic/index.html)\n\nAn elderling member of Spirit. It receives only limited maintanance, but\nit is still used even inside Boost by [Boost.Serialization] and [Boost.Wave]\nlibraries. It also contains Phoenix V1.\n\nSpririt.Classic should support even ancient compilers.\n\n[Boost.Serialization]: http://boost.org/libs/serialization\n[Boost.Wave]: http://boost.org/libs/wave\n\n## Brief History\n\nDate       | Boost | Commit   | Event\n---------- | ----- | -------- | -----------------------------------------------\n2014-03-18 | 1.56  | 8a353328 | Spirit.X3 is added\n2013-12-14 | 1.56  | c0537c82 | Phoenix V2 is retired\n2011-03-28 | 1.47  | 400a764d | [Phoenix V3] support added to Spirit V2\n2009-04-30 | 1.41  | 5963a395 | [Spirit.Repository] is appeared\n2008-04-13 | 1.36  | ffd0cc10 | Spirit V2 (Qi, Karma, Lex, Phoenix V2) is added\n2006-08-23 | 1.35  | 2dc892b4 | Fusion V1 is retired\n2003-01-31 | 1.30  | 81907916 | Spirit is the part of the Boost\n\n[Phoenix V3]: http://boost.org/libs/phoenix\n[Spirit.Repository]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/repository.html\n",
