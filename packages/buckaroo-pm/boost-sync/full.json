  "readme": "# Boost.Sync\n\nBoost.Sync, part of collection of the [Boost C++ Libraries](https://github.com/boostorg), implements thread synchronization primitives.\n\n### Directories\n\n* **build** - Boost.Sync build scripts\n* **doc** - QuickBook documentation sources\n* **include** - Interface headers of Boost.Sync\n* **src** - Compilable source code of Boost.Sync\n* **test** - Boost.Sync unit tests\n\n### More information\n\n* [Documentation](https://boost.org/libs/sync)\n* [Report bugs](https://github.com/boostorg/sync/issues/new). Be sure to mention Boost version, platform and compiler you're using. A small compilable code sample to reproduce the problem is always good as well.\n* Submit your patches as pull requests against **develop** branch. Note that by submitting patches you agree to license your modifications under the [Boost Software License, Version 1.0](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).\n\n### Build status\n\nMaster: [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/x5m5lueci0iu4udr/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Lastique/sync/branch/master) [![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/sync)\nDevelop: [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/x5m5lueci0iu4udr/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Lastique/sync/branch/develop) [![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/sync.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/sync)\n\n### License\n\nDistributed under the [Boost Software License, Version 1.0](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).\n",
