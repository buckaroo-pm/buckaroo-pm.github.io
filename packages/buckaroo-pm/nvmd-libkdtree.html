$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../libkdtree
$ make</p><p>You can use cmake to build the tests and examples on Windows with
Visual C++.  Use the windows cmake to create a Visual C++ solution and
build that.</p><p>Note that cmake and ./configure is not needed at all in order to use
kdtree in your application.  As kdtree is a header-only library, you

(/usr/share/doc/libkdtree++-dev/examples on Debian).</p><p>For those using the ./configure system, the library supports pkg-config.

the tree (this includes erase(value) calls, which search the tree).</p><p>It is ok to call insert(value) many times and optimize() at the end, but
