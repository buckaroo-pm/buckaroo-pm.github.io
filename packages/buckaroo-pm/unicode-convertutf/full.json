  "readme": "The accompanying C source code file \"ConvertUTF.c\" and the associated header\nfile \"ConvertUTF.h\" provide for conversion between various transformation\nformats of Unicode characters.  The following conversions are supported:\n\n\tUTF-32 to UTF-16\n\tUTF-32 to UTF-8\n\tUTF-16 to UTF-32\n\tUTF-16 to UTF-8\n\tUTF-8 to UTF-16\n\tUTF-8 to UTF-32\n\nIn addition, there is a test harness which runs various tests.\n\nThe files \"CVTUTF7.C\" and \"CVTUTF7.H\" are for archival and historical purposes\nonly. They have not been updated to Unicode 3.0 or later and should be\nconsidered obsolescent. \"CVTUTF7.C\" contains two functions that can convert\nbetween UCS2 (i.e., the BMP characters only) and UTF-7. Surrogates are\nnot supported, the code has not been tested, and should be considered\nunsuitable for general purpose use.\n\nPlease submit any bug reports about these programs here:\n\n\thttp://www.unicode.org/unicode/reporting.html\n\nVersion 1.0: initial version.\n\nVersion 1.1: corrected some minor problems; added stricter checks.\n\nVersion 1.2: corrected switch statements associated with \"extraBytesToRead\"\n\tin 4 & 5 byte cases, in functions for conversion from UTF8.\n\tNote: formally, the 4 & 5 byte cases are illegal in the latest\n\tUTF8, but the table and this code has always catered for those,\n\tcases since at one time they were legal.\n\nVersion 1.3: Updated UTF-8 legality check;\n\tupdated to use UNI_MAX_LEGAL_UTF32 in UTF-32 conversions\n\tUpdated UTF-8 legality tests in harness.c\n \n\nLast update: October 19, 2004\n\n",
