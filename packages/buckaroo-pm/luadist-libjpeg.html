more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly
the order listed) before diving into the code.</p><h1>OVERVIEW</h1><p>This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.</p><p>This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren&#x27;t implemented yet.
We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
processes defined in the standard.</p><p>We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</p><p>In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
library if not required for a particular application.</p><p>We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between
different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</p><p>The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p><p>We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</p><h1>LEGAL ISSUES</h1><p>In plain English:</p><ol><li>We don&#x27;t promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
by all standard GIF decoders.</p><p>We are required to state that

understand the innards of the JPEG software.</p><p>The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
Wallace, Gregory K.  &quot;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&quot;,
Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don&#x27;t have the CACM issue
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace&#x27;s article is
available at <a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.ps.gz">http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.ps.gz</a>.  The file (actually
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</p><p>A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
&quot;The Data Compression Book&quot; by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
code but don&#x27;t know much about data compression in general.  The book&#x27;s JPEG
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
at a full implementation, you&#x27;ve got one here...</p><p>The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still
Image Data Compression Standard&quot; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of
JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation
of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT
technology.
If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book,
then you are in delusion.  The real fundamentals and corresponding potential
of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for
all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.</p><p>The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&quot; and has document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension
which is specified in two documents:  A contributed document at ITU and ISO
with title &quot;ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced
Image Coding&quot;, April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland.  The latest version of this
document is Revision 3.  And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N
5799 with title &quot;Evolution of JPEG&quot;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.
IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless
compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/
WG1 N 6080 with title &quot;JPEG 9 Lossless Coding&quot;, June/July 2012, Paris,
France.</p><p>The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
format.  For the omitted details we follow the &quot;JFIF&quot; conventions, revision
1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
download in PDF format from
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm</a>.
A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
<a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz</a>.  There is also a plain text version at
<a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz</a>, but it is missing the figures.</p><p>The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/">http://www.ijg.org/files/</a>.  It is expected that the next revision
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note&#x27;s design.
Although IJG&#x27;s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</p><h1>ARCHIVE LOCATIONS</h1><p>The &quot;official&quot; archive site for this software is <a href="http://www.ijg.org">www.ijg.org</a>.

together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing
the name &quot;JPEG&quot; which is misleading because these formats are incompatible
with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies.
IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes
(see REFERENCES).
There exist also distributions under the name &quot;OpenJPEG&quot; promoting such
kind of formats which is misleading because they don&#x27;t support original
JPEG images.
We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats.  Indeed, one of
the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force
convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
Don&#x27;t use an incompatible file format!
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
image files indefinitely.)</p><p>The ISO committee pretends to be &quot;responsible for the popular JPEG&quot; in their
public reports which is not true because they don&#x27;t respond to actual
requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification.
Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to &quot;ensure interoperability&quot; with
their standards which is not true because their &quot;standards&quot; support only
application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically
incorrect code.</p><p>There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the
name &quot;libjpeg&quot; which is misleading because they don&#x27;t have the features and
are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions.
One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses
the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the
name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG
libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code.
The other one claims to be a &quot;derivative&quot; or &quot;fork&quot; of the original libjpeg,
but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above
and violates basic C programming properties.
We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal
distributions derived from obsolete code bases.
Don&#x27;t use an obsolete code base!</p><p>According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and
legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other
institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and
systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the
value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and
intentional consent.
The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets
are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet.
People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in
the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the
foreclosed institutions and corporations.
IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value
and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of
the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction
or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing,
willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement.
IJG expresses that which already was.
The people have already determined and demanded that public administration
entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must
be fully transparent, accountable, and liable.
IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.</p><p>A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (&quot;Hall of Shame&quot;)
is currently prepared and will be published later.</p><h1>TO DO</h1><p>Version 9 is the second release of a new generation JPEG standard
to overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification,
and is the first true source reference JPEG codec.
More features are being prepared for coming releases...</p><p>Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to <a href="mailto:jpeg-info@jpegclub.org">jpeg-info@jpegclub.org</a>.</p></div></div><div class="banner footer"><div class="view column"><div class="actions"><div class="links"><a href="/">Buckaroo</a><a href="https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki" target="_blank">Docs</a><a href="https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo" target="_blank">GitHub</a></div><div class="signup"><h1 class="action">Sign up for our Newsletter</h1><div class="info">Get the latest updates about new packages and Buckaroo releases.</div><button>Sign Up</button></div></div><div class="powered"><img src="/LoopPerfectInvertSmall.png"/><span>Powered by LoopPerfect</span></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"packageName":"buckaroo-pm/luadist-libjpeg","name":"LuaDist/libjpeg","licence":"","description":"Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software","readme":"The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software\n==========================================\n\nREADME for release 9a of 19-Jan-2014\n====================================\n\nThis distribution contains the ninth public release of the Independent JPEG\nGroup's free JPEG software.

If you don't have the CACM issue\nhandy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\navailable at http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually\na preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\nomits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\nand some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\nand it may not be used for commercial purposes.\n\nA somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\n\"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\nM\u0026T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\ngood explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\nincluding JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\ncode but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG\nsample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\nat a full implementation, you've got one here...\n\nThe best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still\nImage Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.\nMitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.\nPrice US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG\nstandards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).\nAlthough this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of\nJPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation\nof the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT\ntechnology.\nIf you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book,\nthen you are in delusion.  The real fundamentals and corresponding potential\nof DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for\nall the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.\n\nThe original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual\nspecification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is\ntitled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\nPart 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\n10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of\nContinuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document\nnumbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\nIJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension\nwhich is specified in two documents:  A contributed document at ITU and ISO\nwith title \"ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced\nImage Coding\", April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland.  The latest version of this\ndocument is Revision 3.  And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N\n5799 with title \"Evolution of JPEG\", June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.\nIJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless\ncompression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/\nWG1 N 6080 with title \"JPEG 9 Lossless Coding\", June/July 2012, Paris,\nFrance.\n\nThe JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\nformat.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision\n1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report\nand thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free\ndownload in PDF format from\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.\nA PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.\n\nThe TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\nftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\nfound in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\nIJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\nInstead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\n(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision\nof the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\nAlthough IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\nuses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.\n\n\nARCHIVE LOCATIONS\n=================\n\nThe \"official\" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org.\nThe most recent released version can always be found there in\ndirectory \"files\".

Mitchell for inviting me to the\nITU JPEG (Study Group 16) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThank to Thomas Wiegand and Gary Sullivan for inviting me to the\nJoint Video Team (MPEG \u0026 ITU) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThank to Thomas Richter and Daniel Lee for inviting me to the\nISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16)\nmeeting in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThank to John Korejwa and Massimo Ballerini for inviting me to\nfruitful consultations in Boston, MA and Milan, Italy.\n\nThank to Hendrik Elstner, Roland Fassauer, Simone Zuck, Guenther\nMaier-Gerber, Walter Stoeber, Fred Schmitz, and Norbert Braunagel\nfor corresponding business development.\n\nThank to Nico Zschach and Dirk Stelling of the technical support team\nat the Digital Images company in Halle for providing me with extra\nequipment for configuration tests.\n\nThank to Richard F. Lyon (then of Foveon Inc.) for fruitful\ncommunication about JPEG configuration in Sigma Photo Pro software.\n\nThank to Andrew Finkenstadt for hosting the ijg.org site.\n\nLast but not least special thank to Thomas G. Lane for the original\ndesign and development of this singular software package.\n\n\nFILE FORMAT WARS\n================\n\nThe ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG,\ntogether with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing\nthe name \"JPEG\" which is misleading because these formats are incompatible\nwith original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies.\nIJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes\n(see REFERENCES).\nThere exist also distributions under the name \"OpenJPEG\" promoting such\nkind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original\nJPEG images.\nWe have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats.  Indeed, one of\nthe original reasons for developing this free software was to help force\nconvergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.\nDon't use an incompatible file format!\n(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG\nimage files indefinitely.)\n\nThe ISO committee pretends to be \"responsible for the popular JPEG\" in their\npublic reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual\nrequirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification.\nFurthermore, the ISO committee pretends to \"ensure interoperability\" with\ntheir standards which is not true because their \"standards\" support only\napplication-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically\nincorrect code.\n\nThere are currently different distributions in circulation containing the\nname \"libjpeg\" which is misleading because they don't have the features and\nare incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions.\nOne of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses\nthe name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the\nname JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG\nlibjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code.\nThe other one claims to be a \"derivative\" or \"fork\" of the original libjpeg,\nbut violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above\nand violates basic C programming properties.\nWe have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal\ndistributions derived from obsolete code bases.\nDon't use an obsolete code base!\n\nAccording to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and\nlegal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other\ninstitutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and\nsystematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the\nvalue of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and\nintentional consent.\nThe titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets\nare now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet.\nPeople of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in\nthe assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the\nforeclosed institutions and corporations.\nIJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value\nand rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of\nthe people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction\nor the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing,\nwilling and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement.\nIJG expresses that which already was.\nThe people have already determined and demanded that public administration\nentities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must\nbe fully transparent, accountable, and liable.\nIJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.\n\nA partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations (\"Hall of Shame\")\nis currently prepared and will be published later.\n\n\nTO DO\n=====\n\nVersion 9 is the second release of a new generation JPEG standard\nto overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification,\nand is the first true source reference JPEG codec.\nMore features are being prepared for coming releases...\n\nPlease send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@jpegclub.org.\n","versions":[{"ref":"master","manifest":"targets = [ \"//:jpeg\" ]","lockFile":"","buck":"def configure(target):\n  name = 'jconfig-h-' + target.lower()\n  genrule(\n    name
