It is header only, and comes in a single file form for easy inclusion in projects. It is easy to use for small projects, but powerful enough for complex command line projects, and can be customized for frameworks.\nIt is tested on [Travis][] and [AppVeyor][], and is being included in the [GooFit GPU fitting framework][goofit]. It was inspired by [`plumbum.cli`][plumbum] for Python. CLI11 has a user friendly introduction in this README, a more in-depth tutorial [GitBook][], as well as [API documentation][api-docs] generated by Travis.\nSee the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) or [GitHub Releases][] for details for current and past releases. Also see the [Version 1.0 post][], [Version 1.3 post][], or [Version 1.6 post][] for more information.\n\nYou can be notified when new releases are made by subscribing to <https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/releases.atom> on an RSS reader, like Feedly.\n\n### Why write another CLI parser?\n\nAn acceptable CLI parser library should be all of the following:\n\n-   Easy to include (i.e., header only, one file if possible, **no external requirements**).\n-   Short, simple syntax: This is one of the main reasons to use a CLI parser, it should make variables from the command line nearly as easy to define as any other variables. If most of your program is hidden in CLI parsing, this is a problem for readability.\n-   C++11 or better: Should work with GCC 4.7+ (such as GCC 4.8 on CentOS 7), Clang 3.5+, AppleClang 7+, NVCC 7.0+, or MSVC 2015+.\n-   Work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n-   Well tested using [Travis][] (Linux and macOS) and [AppVeyor][] (Windows). \"Well\" is defined as having good coverage measured by [CodeCov][].\n-   Clear help printing.\n-   Nice error messages.\n-   Standard shell idioms supported naturally, like grouping flags, a positional separator, etc.\n-   Easy to execute, with help, parse errors, etc. providing correct exit and details.\n-   Easy to extend as part of a framework that provides \"applications\" to users.\n-   Usable subcommand syntax, with support for multiple subcommands, nested subcommands, and optional fallthrough (explained later).\n-   Ability to add a configuration file (`ini` format), and produce it as well.\n-   Produce real values that can be used directly in code, not something you have pay compute time to look up, for HPC applications.\n-   Work with standard types, simple custom types, and extendible to exotic types.\n-   Permissively licensed.\n\n### Other parsers\n\n<details><summary>The major CLI parsers for C++ include, with my biased opinions: (click to expand)</summary><p>\n\n| Library                             | My biased opinion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Boost Program Options][]           | A great library if you already depend on Boost, but its pre-C++11 syntax is really odd and setting up the correct call in the main function is poorly documented (and is nearly a page of code). A simple wrapper for the Boost library was originally developed, but was discarded as CLI11 became more powerful. The idea of capturing a value and setting it originated with Boost PO. [See this comparison.][cli11-po-compare] |\n| [The Lean Mean C++ Option Parser][] | One header file is great, but the syntax is atrocious, in my opinion. It was quite impractical to wrap the syntax or to use in a complex project. It seems to handle standard parsing quite well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| [TCLAP][]                           | The not-quite-standard command line parsing causes common shortcuts to fail. It also seems to be poorly supported, with only minimal bugfixes accepted. Header only, but in quite a few files. Has not managed to get enough support to move to GitHub yet. No subcommands. Produces wrapped values.                                                                                                                               |\n| [Cxxopts][]                         | C++11, single file, and nice CMake support, but requires regex, therefore GCC 4.8 (CentOS 7 default) does not work. Syntax closely based on Boost PO, so not ideal but familiar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| [DocOpt][]                          | Completely different approach to program options in C++11, you write the docs and the interface is generated. Too fragile and specialized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\nAfter I wrote this, I also found the following libraries:\n\n| Library                 | My biased opinion                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [GFlags][]              | The Google Commandline Flags library. Uses macros heavily, and is limited in scope, missing things like subcommands. It provides a simple syntax and supports config files/env vars. |\n| [GetOpt][]              | Very limited C solution with long, convoluted syntax. Does not support much of anything, like help generation. Always available on UNIX, though (but in different flavors).          |\n| [ProgramOptions.hxx][]  | Intresting library, less powerful and no subcommands. Nice callback system.                                                                                                          |\n| [Args][]                | Also interesting, and supports subcommands. I like the optional-like design, but CLI11 is cleaner and provides direct value access, and is less verbose.                             |\n| [Argument Aggregator][] | I'm a big fan of the [fmt][] library, and the try-catch statement looks familiar.  :thumbsup: Doesn't seem to support subcommands.                                                   |\n| [Clara][]               | Simple library built for the excellent [Catch][] testing framework. Unique syntax, limited scope.                                                                                    |\n| [Argh!][]               | Very minimalistic C++11 parser, single header. Don't have many features. No help generation?!?! At least it's exception-free.                                                        |\n| [CLI][]                 | Custom language and parser. Huge build-system overkill for very little benefit. Last release in 2009, but still occasionally active.                                                 |\n\nSee [Awesome C++][] for a less-biased list of parsers. You can also find other single file libraries at [Single file libs][].\n\n</p></details>\n<br/>\n\nNone of these libraries fulfill all the above requirements, or really even come close. As you probably have already guessed, CLI11 does.\nSo, this library was designed to provide a great syntax, good compiler compatibility, and minimal installation fuss.\n\n### Features not supported by this library\n\nThere are some other possible \"features\" that are intentionally not supported by this library:\n\n-   Non-standard variations on syntax, like `-long` options. This is non-standard and should be avoided, so that is enforced by this library.\n-   Completion of partial options, such as Python's `argparse` supplies for incomplete arguments. It's better not to guess. Most third party command line parsers for python actually reimplement command line parsing rather than using argparse because of this perceived design flaw.\n-   In C++14, you could have a set of `callback` methods with differing signatures (tested in a branch). Not deemed worth having a C++14 variation on API and removed.\n-   Autocomplete: This might eventually be added to both Plumbum and CLI11, but it is not supported yet.\n-   Wide strings / unicode: Since this uses the standard library only, it might be hard to properly implement, but I would be open to suggestions in how to do this.\n\n## Install\n\nTo use, there are two methods:\n\n1.  Copy `CLI11.hpp` from the [most recent release][github releases] into your include directory, and you are set. This is combined from the source files  for every release. This includes the entire command parser library, but does not include separate utilities (like `Timer`, `AutoTimer`). The utilities are completely self contained and can be copied separately.\n2.  Use `CLI/*.hpp` files. You could check out the repository as a submodule, for example. You can use the `CLI11::CLI11` interface target when linking from `add_subdirectory`.\n    You can also configure and optionally install the project, and then use `find_package(CLI11 CONFIG)` to get the `CLI11::CLI11` target. You can also use [Conan.io][conan-link] or [Hunter][].\n    (These are just conveniences to allow you to use your favorite method of managing packages; it's just header only so including the correct path and\n    using C++11 is all you really need.)\n\nTo build the tests, checkout the repository and use CMake:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nGTEST_COLOR=1 CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Adding options\n\nTo set up, add options, and run, your main function will look something like this:\n\n```cpp\nCLI::App app{\"App description\"};\n\nstd::string filename = \"default\";\napp.add_option(\"-f,--file\", filename, \"A help string\");\n\nCLI11_PARSE(app, argc, argv);\n```\n\n<details><summary>Note: If you don't like macros, this is what that macro expands to: (click to expand)</summary><p>\n\n```cpp\ntry {\n    app.parse(argc, argv);\n} catch (const CLI::ParseError &e) {\n    return app.exit(e);\n}\n```\n\nThe try/catch block ensures that `-h,--help` or a parse error will exit with the correct return code (selected from `CLI::ExitCodes`). (The return here should be inside `main`). You should not assume that the option values have been set inside the catch block; for example, help flags intentionally short-circuit all other processing for speed and to ensure required options and the like do not interfere.\n\n</p></details>\n</br>\n\nThe initialization is just one line, adding options is just two each. The parse macro is just one line (or 5 for the contents of the macro).  After the app runs, the filename will be set to the correct value if it was passed, otherwise it will be set to the default. You can check to see if this was passed on the command line with `app.count(\"--file\")`.\n\n#### Option types\n\nWhile all options internally are the same type, there are several ways to add an option depending on what you need. The supported values are:\n\n```cpp\napp.add_option(option_name,\n               variable_to_bind_to, // int, float, vector, or string-like\n               help_string=\"\",\n               default=false)\n\napp.add_option_function<type>(option_name,\n               function <void(const type &value)>, // int, float, vector, or string-like\n               help_string=\"\")\n\napp.add_complex(... // Special case: support for complex numbers\n\napp.add_flag(option_name,\n             int_or_bool = nothing,\n             help_string=\"\")\n\napp.add_flag_function(option_name,\n             function <void(size_t count)>,\n             help_string=\"\")\n\napp.add_set(option_name,\n            variable_to_bind_to,     // Same type as stored by set\n            set_of_possible_options, // Set will be copied, ignores changes\n            help_string=\"\",\n            default=false)\napp.add_mutable_set(... // Set can change later, keeps reference\n\napp.add_set_ignore_case(...                    // String only\napp.add_mutable_set_ignore_case(...            // String only\napp.add_set_ignore_underscore(...              // String only\napp.add_mutable_set_ignore_underscore(...      // String only\napp.add_set_ignore_case_underscore(...         // String only\napp.add_mutable_set_ignore_case_underscore(... // String only\n\nApp* subcom = app.add_subcommand(name, description);\n```\n\nAn option name must start with a alphabetic character or underscore. For long options, anything but an equals sign or a comma is valid after that. Names are given as a comma separated string, with the dash or dashes. An option or flag can have as many names as you want, and afterward, using `count`, you can use any of the names, with dashes as needed, to count the options. One of the names is allowed to be given without proceeding dash(es); if present the option is a positional option, and that name will be used on help line for its positional form. If you want the default value to print in the help description, pass in `true` for the final parameter for `add_option` or `add_set`. The set options allow your users to pick from a set of predefined options, and you can use an initializer list directly if you like. If you need to modify the set later, use the `mutable` forms.\n\nThe `add_option_function<type>(...` function will typically require the template parameter be given unless a std::function object with an exact match is passed.  The type can be any type supported by the `add_option` function\n\nOn a C++14 compiler, you can pass a callback function directly to `.add_flag`, while in C++11 mode you'll need to use `.add_flag_function` if you want a callback function. The function will be given the number of times the flag was passed. You can throw a relevant `CLI::ParseError` to signal a failure.\n\nOn a compiler that supports C++17's `__has_include`, you can also use `std::optional`, `std::experimental::optional`, and `boost::optional` directly in an `add_option` call. If you don't have `__has_include`, you can define `CLI11_BOOST_OPTIONAL 1` before including CLI11 to manually add support (or 0 to remove) for `boost::optional`. See [CLI11 Internals][] for information on how this was done and how you can add your own converters.\n\n#### Example\n\n-   `\"one,-o,--one\"`: Valid as long as not a flag, would create an option that can be specified positionally, or with `-o` or `--one`\n-   `\"this\"` Can only be passed positionally\n-   `\"-a,-b,-c\"` No limit to the number of non-positional option names\n\nThe add commands return a pointer to an internally stored `Option`. If you set the final argument to true, the default value is captured and printed on the command line with the help flag. This option can be used directly to check for the count (`->count()`) after parsing to avoid a string based lookup.\n\n#### Option options\n\nBefore parsing, you can set the following options:\n\n-   `->required()`: The program will quit if this option is not present. This is `mandatory` in Plumbum, but required options seems to be a more standard term. For compatibility, `->mandatory()` also works.\n-   `->expected(N)`: Take `N` values instead of as many as possible, only for vector args. If negative, require at least `-N`; end with `--` or another recognized option.\n-   `->type_name(typename)`: Set the name of an Option's type (`type_name_fn` allows a function instead)\n-   `->type_size(N)`: Set the intrinsic size of an option. The parser will require multiples of this number if negative.\n-   `->needs(opt)`: This option requires another option to also be present, opt is an `Option` pointer.\n-   `->excludes(opt)`: This option cannot be given with `opt` present, opt is an `Option` pointer.\n-   `->envname(name)`: Gets the value from the environment if present and not passed on the command line.\n-   `->group(name)`: The help group to put the option in. No effect for positional options. Defaults to `\"Options\"`. `\"\"` will not show up in the help print (hidden).\n-   `->ignore_case()`: Ignore the case on the command line (also works on subcommands, does not affect arguments).\n-   `->ignore_underscore()`: Ignore any underscores in the options names (also works on subcommands, does not affect arguments). For example \"option_one\" will match with optionone.  This does not apply to short form options since they only have one character\n-   `->description(str)`: Set/change the description.\n-   `->multi_option_policy(CLI::MultiOptionPolicy::Throw)`: Set the multi-option policy. Shortcuts available: `->take_last()`, `->take_first()`, and `->join()`. This will only affect options expecting 1 argument or bool flags (which always default to take last).\n-   `->check(CLI::ExistingFile)`: Requires that the file exists if given.\n-   `->check(CLI::ExistingDirectory)`: Requires that the directory exists.\n-   `->check(CLI::ExistingPath)`: Requires that the path (file or directory) exists.\n-   `->check(CLI::NonexistentPath)`: Requires that the path does not exist.\n-   `->check(CLI::Range(min,max))`: Requires that the option be between min and max (make sure to use floating point if needed). Min defaults to 0.\n-   `->transform(std::string(std::string))`: Converts the input string into the output string, in-place in the parsed options.\n-   `->each(void(std::string)>`: Run this function on each value received, as it is received.\n-   `->configurable(false)`: Disable this option from being in a configuration file.\n\nThese options return the `Option` pointer, so you can chain them together, and even skip storing the pointer entirely. Check takes any function that has the signature `void(const std::string&)`; it should throw a `ValidationError` when validation fails. The help message will have the name of the parent option prepended. Since `check` and `transform` use the same underlying mechanism, you can chain as many as you want, and they will be executed in order. If you just want to see the unconverted values, use `.results()` to get the `std::vector<std::string>` of results. Validate can also be a subclass of `CLI::Validator`, in which case it can also set the type name and can be combined with `&` and `|` (all built-in validators are this sort).\n\nOn the command line, options can be given as:\n\n-   `-a` (flag)\n-   `-abc` (flags can be combined)\n-   `-f filename` (option)\n-   `-ffilename` (no space required)\n-   `-abcf filename` (flags and option can be combined)\n-   `--long` (long flag)\n-   `--file filename` (space)\n-   `--file=filename` (equals)\n\nIf allow_windows_style_options() is specified in the application or subcommand options can also be given as:\n-   `/a` (flag)\n-   `/f filename` (option)\n-   `/long` (long flag)\n-   `/file filename` (space)\n-   `/file:filename` (colon)\n=  Windows style options do not allow combining short options or values not separated from the short option like with `-` options\n\nExtra positional arguments will cause the program to exit, so at least one positional option with a vector is recommended if you want to allow extraneous arguments.\nIf you set `.allow_extras()` on the main `App`, you will not get an error. You can access the missing options using `remaining` (if you have subcommands, `app.remaining(true)` will get all remaining options, subcommands included).\n\nYou can access a vector of pointers to the parsed options in the original order using `parse_order()`.\nIf `--` is present in the command line that does not end an unlimited option, then\neverything after that is positional only.\n\n### Subcommands\n\nSubcommands are supported, and can be nested infinitely. To add a subcommand, call the `add_subcommand` method with a name and an optional description. This gives a pointer to an `App` that behaves just like the main app, and can take options or further subcommands. Add `->ignore_case()` to a subcommand to allow any variation of caps to also be accepted. `->ignore_underscore()` is similar, but for underscores. Children inherit the current setting from the parent. You cannot add multiple matching subcommand names at the same level (including ignore\ncase).\n\nIf you want to require that at least one subcommand is given, use `.require_subcommand()` on the parent app. You can optionally give an exact number of subcommands to require, as well. If you give two arguments, that sets the min and max number allowed.\n0 for the max number allowed will allow an unlimited number of subcommands. As a handy shortcut, a single negative value N will set \"up to N\" values. Limiting the maximimum number allows you to keep arguments that match a previous\nsubcommand name from matching.\n\nIf an `App` (main or subcommand) has been parsed on the command line, `->parsed` will be true (or convert directly to bool).\nAll `App`s have a `get_subcommands()` method, which returns a list of pointers to the subcommands passed on the command line. A `got_subcommand(App_or_name)` method is also provided that will check to see if an `App` pointer or a string name was collected on the command line.\n\nFor many cases, however, using an app's callback may be easier. Every app executes a callback function after it parses; just use a lambda function (with capture to get parsed values) to `.callback`. If you throw `CLI::Success` or `CLI::RuntimeError(return_value)`, you can\neven exit the program through the callback. The main `App` has a callback slot, as well, but it is generally not as useful.\nYou are allowed to throw `CLI::Success` in the callbacks.\nMultiple subcommands are allowed, to allow [`Click`][click] like series of commands (order is preserved).\n\n#### Subcommand options\n\nThere are several options that are supported on the main app and subcommands. These are:\n\n-   `.ignore_case()`: Ignore the case of this subcommand. Inherited by added subcommands, so is usually used on the main `App`.\n-   `.ignore_underscore()`: Ignore any underscores in the subcommand name. Inherited by added subcommands, so is usually used on the main `App`.\n-   `.allow_windows_style_options()`:  Allow command line options to be parsed in the form of `/s /long /file:file_name.ext`  This option does not change how options are specified in the `add_option` calls or the ability to process options in the form of `-s --long --file=file_name.ext`\n-   `.fallthrough()`: Allow extra unmatched options and positionals to \"fall through\" and be matched on a parent command. Subcommands always are allowed to fall through.\n-   `.require_subcommand()`: Require 1 or more subcommands.\n-   `.require_subcommand(N)`: Require `N` subcommands if `N>0`, or up to `N` if `N<0`. `N=0` resets to the default 0 or more.\n-   `.require_subcommand(min, max)`: Explicitly set min and max allowed subcommands. Setting `max` to 0 is unlimited.\n-   `.add_subcommand(name, description=\"\")` Add a subcommand, returns a pointer to the internally stored subcommand.\n-   `.got_subcommand(App_or_name)`: Check to see if a subcommand was received on the command line.\n-   `.get_subcommands(filter)`: The list of subcommands given on the command line.\n-   `.get_parent()`: Get the parent App or nullptr if called on master App.\n-   `.get_option(name)`: Get an option pointer by option name\n-   `.get_options(filter)`: Get the list of all defined option pointers (useful for processing the app for custom output formats).\n-   `.parse_order()`: Get the list of option pointers in the order they were parsed (including duplicates).\n-   `.formatter(fmt)`: Set a formatter, with signature `std::string(const App*, std::string, AppFormatMode)`. See Formatting for more details.\n-   `.description(str)`: Set/change the description.\n-   `.get_description()`: Access the description.\n-   `.parsed()`: True if this subcommand was given on the command line.\n-   `.name(name)`: Add or change the name.\n-   `.callback(void() function)`: Set the callback that runs at the end of parsing. The options have already run at this point.\n-   `.allow_extras()`: Do not throw an error if extra arguments are left over.\n-   `.prefix_command()`: Like `allow_extras`, but stop immediately on the first unrecognized item. It is ideal for allowing your app or subcommand to be a \"prefix\" to calling another app.\n-   `.footer(message)`: Set text to appear at the bottom of the help string.\n-   `.set_help_flag(name, message)`: Set the help flag name and message, returns a pointer to the created option.\n-   `.set_help_all_flag(name, message)`: Set the help all flag name and message, returns a pointer to the created option. Expands subcommands.\n-   `.failure_message(func)`: Set the failure message function. Two provided: `CLI::FailureMessage::help` and `CLI::FailureMessage::simple` (the default).\n-   `.group(name)`: Set a group name, defaults to `\"Subcommands\"`. Setting `\"\"` will be hide the subcommand.\n\n> Note: if you have a fixed number of required positional options, that will match before subcommand names. `{}` is an empty filter function.\n\n### Configuration file\n\n```cpp\napp.set_config(option_name=\"\",\n               default_file_name=\"\",\n               help_string=\"Read an ini file\",\n               required=false)\n```\n\nIf this is called with no arguments, it will remove the configuration file option (like `set_help_flag`). Setting a configuration option is special. If it is present, it will be read along with the normal command line arguments. The file will be read if it exists, and does not throw an error unless `required` is `true`. Configuration files are in `ini` format by default (other formats can be added by an adept user). An example of a file:\n\n```ini\n; Comments are supported, using a ;\n; The default section is [default], case insensitive\n\nvalue = 1\nstr = \"A string\"\nvector = 1 2 3\nstr_vector = \"one\" \"two\" \"and three\"\n\n; Sections map to subcommands\n[subcommand]\nin_subcommand = Wow\nsub.subcommand = true\n```\n\nSpaces before and after the name and argument are ignored. Multiple arguments are separated by spaces. One set of quotes will be removed, preserving spaces (the same way the command line works). Boolean options can be `true`, `on`, `1`, `yes`; or `false`, `off`, `0`, `no` (case insensitive). Sections (and `.` separated names) are treated as subcommands (note: this does not mean that subcommand was passed, it just sets the \"defaults\". You cannot set positional-only arguments or force subcommands to be present in the command line.\n\nTo print a configuration file from the passed\narguments, use `.config_to_str(default_also=false, prefix=\"\", write_description=false)`, where `default_also` will also show any defaulted arguments, `prefix` will add a prefix, and `write_description` will include option descriptions.\n\n### Inheriting defaults\n\nMany of the defaults for subcommands and even options are inherited from their creators. The inherited default values for subcommands are `allow_extras`, `prefix_command`, `ignore_case`, `ignore_underscore`, `fallthrough`, `group`, `footer`, and maximum number of required subcommands. The help flag existence, name, and description are inherited, as well.\n\nOptions have defaults for `group`, `required`, `multi_option_policy`, `ignore_underscore`, and `ignore_case`. To set these defaults, you should set the `option_defaults()` object, for example:\n\n```cpp\napp.option_defaults()->required();\n// All future options will be required\n```\n\nThe default settings for options are inherited to subcommands, as well.\n\n### Formatting\n\nThe job of formatting help printouts is delegated to a formatter callable object on Apps and Options. You are free to replace either formatter by calling `formatter(fmt)` on an `App`, where fmt is any copyable callable with the correct signature.\nCLI11 comes with a default App formatter functional, `Formatter`. It is customizable; you can set `label(key, value)` to replace the default labels like `REQUIRED`, and `column_width(n)` to set the width of the columns before you add the functional to the app or option. You can also override almost any stage of the formatting process in a subclass of either formatter. If you want to make a new formatter from scratch, you can do\nthat too; you just need to implement the correct signature. The first argument is a const pointer to the in question. The formatter will get a `std::string` usage name as the second option, and a `AppFormatMode` mode for the final option. It should return a `std::string`.\n\nThe `AppFormatMode` can be `Normal`, `All`, or `Sub`, and it indicates the situation the help was called in. `Sub` is optional, but the default formatter uses it to make sure expanded subcommands are called with\ntheir own formatter since you can't access anything but the call operator once a formatter has been set.\n\n### Subclassing\n\nThe App class was designed allow toolkits to subclass it, to provide preset default options (see above) and setup/teardown code. Subcommands remain an unsubclassed `App`, since those are not expected to need setup and teardown. The default `App` only adds a help flag, `-h,--help`, than can removed/replaced using `.set_help_flag(name, help_string)`. You can also set a help-all flag with `.set_help_all_flag(name, help_string)`; this will expand the subcommands (one level only). You can remove options if you have pointers to them using `.remove_option(opt)`. You can add a `pre_callback` override to customize the after parse\nbut before run behavior, while\nstill giving the user freedom to `callback` on the main app.\n\nThe most important parse function is `parse(std::vector<std::string>)`, which takes a reversed list of arguments (so that `pop_back` processes the args in the correct order). `get_help_ptr` and `get_config_ptr` give you access to the help/config option pointers. The standard `parse` manually sets the name from the first argument, so it should not be in this vector. You can also use `parse(string, bool)` to split up and parse a string; the optional bool should be set to true if you are\nincluding the program name in the string, and false otherwise.\n\nAlso, in a related note, the `App` you get a pointer to is stored in the parent `App` in a `unique_ptr`s (like `Option`s) and are deleted when the main `App` goes out of scope.\n\n### How it works\n\nEvery `add_` option you have seen so far depends on one method that takes a lambda function. Each of these methods is just making a different lambda function with capture to populate the option. The function has full access to the vector of strings, so it knows how many times an option was passed or how many arguments it received (flags add empty strings to keep the counts correct). The lambda returns `true` if it could validate the option strings, and\n`false` if it failed.\n\nOther values can be added as long as they support `operator>>` (and defaults can be printed if they support `operator<<`). To add an enum, for example, provide a custom `operator>>` with an `istream` (inside the CLI namespace is fine if you don't want to interfere with an existing `operator>>`).\n\nIf you wanted to extend this to support a completely new type, just use a lambda. An example of a new parser for `complex<double>` that supports all of the features of a standard `add_options` call is in [one of the tests](./tests/NewParseTest.cpp). A simpler example is shown below:\n\n#### Example\n\n```cpp\napp.add_option(\"--fancy-count\", [](std::vector<std::string> val){\n    std::cout << \"This option was given \" << val.size() << \" times.\" << std::endl;\n    return true;\n    });\n```\n\n### Utilities\n\nThere are a few other utilities that are often useful in CLI programming. These are in separate headers, and do not appear in `CLI11.hpp`, but are completely independent and can be used as needed. The `Timer`/`AutoTimer` class allows you to easily time a block of code, with custom print output.\n\n```cpp\n{\nCLI::AutoTimer timer {\"My Long Process\", CLI::Timer::Big};\nsome_long_running_process();\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a timer with a title (default: `Timer`), and will customize the output using the predefined `Big` output (default: `Simple`). Because it is an `AutoTimer`, it will print out the time elapsed when the timer is destroyed at the end of the block. If you use `Timer` instead, you can use `to_string` or `std::cout << timer << std::endl;` to print the time. The print function can be any function that takes two strings, the title and the time, and returns a formatted\nstring for printing.\n\n### Other libraries\n\nIf you use the excellent [Rang][] library to add color to your terminal in a safe, multi-platform way, you can combine it with CLI11 nicely:\n\n```cpp\nstd::atexit([](){std::cout << rang::style::reset;});\ntry {\n    app.parse(argc, argv);\n} catch (const CLI::ParseError &e) {\n    std::cout << (e.get_exit_code()==0 ? rang::fg::blue : rang::fg::red);\n    return app.exit(e);\n}\n```\n\nThis will print help in blue, errors in red, and will reset before returning the terminal to the user.\n\nIf you are on a Unix-like system, and you'd like to handle control-c and color, you can add:\n\n```cpp\n #include <csignal>\n void signal_handler(int s) {\n     std::cout << std::endl << rang::style::reset << rang::fg::red << rang::fg::bold;\n     std::cout << \"Control-C detected, exiting...\" << rang::style::reset << std::endl;\n     std::exit(1); // will call the correct exit func, no unwinding of the stack though\n }\n```\n\nAnd, in your main function:\n\n```cpp\n     // Nice Control-C\n     struct sigaction sigIntHandler;\n     sigIntHandler.sa_handler = signal_handler;\n     sigemptyset(&sigIntHandler.sa_mask);\n     sigIntHandler.sa_flags = 0;\n     sigaction(SIGINT, &sigIntHandler, nullptr);\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe API is [documented here][api-docs].
