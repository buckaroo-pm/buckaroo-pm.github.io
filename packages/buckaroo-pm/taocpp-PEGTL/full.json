Whether/which actions are taken, and whether/which data structures are created during a parsing run, is entirely up to the user.\n\nIncluded are some [examples](doc/Contrib-and-Examples.md#examples) for typical situation like unescaping escape sequences in strings, building a generic [JSON](http://www.json.org/) data structure, and on-the-fly evaluation of arithmetic expressions.\n\nThrough the use of template programming and template specialisations it is possible to write a grammar once, and use it in multiple ways with different (semantic) actions in different (or the same) parsing runs.\n\nWith the PEG formalism, the separation into lexer and parser stages is usually dropped -- everything is done in a single grammar.\nThe rules are expressed in C++ as template instantiations, and it is the compiler's task to optimise PEGTL grammars.\n\n## Status\n\nEach commit is automatically tested with multiple architectures, operating systems, compilers, and versions thereof.\n\n* Windows (UWP)\n\n  * Visual Studio 2017 (x86, x64)\n\n* macOS (using libc++)\n\n  * macOS 10.13, Xcode 9.4\n  * macOS 10.13, Xcode 10.0\n\n* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (using libstdc++)\n\n  * GCC 7.x, 8.x\n  * Clang 5.x, 6.x, 7.x\n\nAdditionally, each commit is checked with GCC's and Clang's sanitizers, as well as [`valgrind`](http://valgrind.org/)\nand [`clang-tidy`](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/). Code coverage is automatically measured and the unit tests\ncover 100% of the core library code (for releases).\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/releases) are done in accordance with [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\nIncompatible API changes are *only* allowed to occur between major versions.\nFor details see the [changelog](doc/Changelog.md).\n\n## Contact\n\nThe PEGTL is part of [The Art of C++](https://taocpp.github.io/).\n\nFor questions and suggestions regarding the PEGTL, success or failure stories, and any other kind of feedback, please feel free to contact the authors at `taocpp(at)icemx.net`.\n\n## Thank You\n\n* Christopher Diggins and the YARD parser for the general idea.\n* George Makrydakis for the [inspiration](https://github.com/irrequietus/typestring) to `TAO_PEGTL_STRING`.\n* Johannes Overmann for his invaluable [`streplace`](https://code.google.com/p/streplace/) command-line tool.\n* Jörg-Christian Böhme for improving the Android CI build.\n* Jørgen Edelbo for UWP support.\n* Kai Wolf for help with CMake.\n* Kenneth Geisshirt for Android compatibility and Android CI.\n* Kuzma Shapran for EOL testing and fixes.\n* Michael Becker for help with CMake.\n* Paul Le Roux for CMake improvements and Conan support.\n* Paulo Custodio for Windows-related fixes.\n* Sam Hocevar for contributing Visual Studio 2015 compatibility.\n* Stephan Beal for the bug reports, suggestions and discussions.\n* Stuart Dootson for `mmap_input<>` support on Windows.\n* Sven Johannsen for help with CMake.\n* Zhihao Yuan for fixing several warnings when compiling with Visual Studio 2015.\n\n## License\n\nThe PEGTL is certified [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html) software.
