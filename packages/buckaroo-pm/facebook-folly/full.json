  "readme": "Folly: Facebook Open-source Library\n-----------------------------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/folly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/folly)\n\n### What is `folly`?\n\nFolly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a\nlibrary of C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency\nin mind. **Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively\nat Facebook**. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other\nopen source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.\n\nIt complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings\nsuch as Boost and of course `std`. In fact, we embark on defining our\nown component only when something we need is either not available, or\ndoes not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to remove\nthings from folly if or when `std` or Boost obsoletes them.\n\nPerformance concerns permeate much of Folly, sometimes leading to\ndesigns that are more idiosyncratic than they would otherwise be (see\ne.g. `PackedSyncPtr.h`, `SmallLocks.h`). Good performance at large\nscale is a unifying theme in all of Folly.\n\n### Logical Design\n\nFolly is a collection of relatively independent components, some as\nsimple as a few symbols. There is no restriction on internal\ndependencies, meaning that a given folly module may use any other\nfolly components.\n\nAll symbols are defined in the top-level namespace `folly`, except of\ncourse macros. Macro names are ALL_UPPERCASE and should be prefixed\nwith `FOLLY_`. Namespace `folly` defines other internal namespaces\nsuch as `internal` or `detail`. User code should not depend on symbols\nin those namespaces.\n\nFolly has an `experimental` directory as well. This designation connotes\nprimarily that we feel the API may change heavily over time. This code,\ntypically, is still in heavy use and is well tested.\n\n### Physical Design\n\nAt the top level Folly uses the classic \"stuttering\" scheme\n`folly/folly` used by Boost and others. The first directory serves as\nan installation root of the library (with possible versioning a la\n`folly-1.0/`), and the second is to distinguish the library when\nincluding files, e.g. `#include <folly/FBString.h>`.\n\nThe directory structure is flat (mimicking the namespace structure),\ni.e. we don't have an elaborate directory hierarchy (it is possible\nthis will change in future versions). The subdirectory `experimental`\ncontains files that are used inside folly and possibly at Facebook but\nnot considered stable enough for client use. Your code should not use\nfiles in `folly/experimental` lest it may break when you update Folly.\n\nThe `folly/folly/test` subdirectory includes the unittests for all\ncomponents, usually named `ComponentXyzTest.cpp` for each\n`ComponentXyz.*`. The `folly/folly/docs` directory contains\ndocumentation.\n\n### What's in it?\n\nBecause of folly's fairly flat structure, the best way to see what's in it\nis to look at the headers in [top level `folly/` directory](https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly). You can also\ncheck the [`docs` folder](folly/docs) for documentation, starting with the\n[overview](folly/docs/Overview.md).\n\nFolly is published on GitHub at https://github.com/facebook/folly\n\n### Build Notes\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nfolly requires gcc 5.1+ and a version of boost compiled with C++14 support.\n\ngoogletest is required to build and run folly's tests.  You can download\nit from https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz\nThe following commands can be used to download and install it:\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz && \\\ntar zxf release-1.8.0.tar.gz && \\\nrm -f release-1.8.0.tar.gz && \\\ncd googletest-release-1.8.0 && \\\ncmake . && \\\nmake && \\\nmake install\n```\n\n#### Finding dependencies in non-default locations\n\nIf you have boost, gtest, or other dependencies installed in a non-default\nlocation, you can use the `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`\nvariables to make CMAKE look also look for header files and libraries in\nnon-standard locations.  For example, to also search the directories\n`/alt/include/path1` and `/alt/include/path2` for header files and the\ndirectories `/alt/lib/path1` and `/alt/lib/path2` for libraries, you can invoke\n`cmake` as follows:\n\n```\ncmake \\\n  -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/alt/include/path1:/alt/include/path2 \\\n  -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/alt/lib/path1:/alt/lib/path2 ...\n```\n\n#### Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\nThe following packages are required (feel free to cut and paste the apt-get\ncommand below):\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    g++ \\\n    cmake \\\n    libboost-all-dev \\\n    libevent-dev \\\n    libdouble-conversion-dev \\\n    libgoogle-glog-dev \\\n    libgflags-dev \\\n    libiberty-dev \\\n    liblz4-dev \\\n    liblzma-dev \\\n    libsnappy-dev \\\n    make \\\n    zlib1g-dev \\\n    binutils-dev \\\n    libjemalloc-dev \\\n    libssl-dev \\\n    pkg-config\n```\n\nIf advanced debugging functionality is required, use:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    libunwind8-dev \\\n    libelf-dev \\\n    libdwarf-dev\n```\n\nIn the folly directory (e.g. the checkout root or the archive unpack root), run:\n```\n  mkdir _build && cd _build\n  cmake ..\n  make -j $(nproc)\n  make install # with either sudo or DESTDIR as necessary\n```\n\n#### OS X (Homebrew)\n\nfolly is available as a Formula and releases may be built via `brew install folly`.\n\nYou may also use `folly/build/bootstrap-osx-homebrew.sh` to build against `master`:\n\n```\n  ./folly/build/bootstrap-osx-homebrew.sh\n```\n\nThis will create a build directory `_build` in the top-level.\n\n#### OS X (MacPorts)\n\nInstall the required packages from MacPorts:\n\n```\n  sudo port install \\\n    boost \\\n    cmake \\\n    gflags \\\n    git \\\n    google-glog \\\n    libevent \\\n    libtool \\\n    lz4 \\\n    lzma \\\n    openssl \\\n    snappy \\\n    xz \\\n    zlib\n```\n\nDownload and install double-conversion:\n\n```\n  git clone https://github.com/google/double-conversion.git\n  cd double-conversion\n  cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .\n  make\n  sudo make install\n```\n\nDownload and install folly with the parameters listed below:\n\n```\n  git clone https://github.com/facebook/folly.git\n  cd folly\n  mkdir _build\n  cd _build\n  cmake ..\n  make\n  sudo make install\n```\n\n#### Windows (Vcpkg)\n\nfolly is available in [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#vcpkg) and releases may be built via `vcpkg install folly:x64-windows`.\n\nYou may also use `vcpkg install folly:x64-windows --head` to build against `master`.\n\n#### Other Linux distributions\n\n- double-conversion (https://github.com/google/double-conversion)\n\n  Download and build double-conversion.\n  You may need to tell cmake where to find it.\n\n  [double-conversion/] `ln -s src double-conversion`\n\n  [folly/] `mkdir build && cd build`\n  [folly/build/] `cmake \"-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=$DOUBLE_CONVERSION_HOME/include\" \"-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$DOUBLE_CONVERSION_HOME/lib\" ..`\n\n  [folly/build/] `make`\n\n- additional platform specific dependencies:\n\n  Fedora >= 21 64-bit (last tested on Fedora 28 64-bit)\n    - gcc\n    - gcc-c++\n    - cmake\n    - automake\n    - boost-devel\n    - libtool\n    - lz4-devel\n    - lzma-devel\n    - snappy-devel\n    - zlib-devel\n    - glog-devel\n    - gflags-devel\n    - scons\n    - double-conversion-devel\n    - openssl-devel\n    - libevent-devel\n\n  Optional\n    - libdwarf-dev\n    - libelf-dev\n    - libunwind8-dev\n",
